Steps to Run -
compile the program and generate an executable file assuming (a.out) in my case
run using the command
./a.out <name_of_the_input_file> <iterations>

name_of_the_input_file :- give the path of the input file
itertions :- optional argument, by default 10000 iterations will be running but can be tuned in runtime using this argument
